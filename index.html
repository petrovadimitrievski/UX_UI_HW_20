    <p class="scenario">Time passed me by very quickly. I feel that the Feed My Starving Children website redesigned has taught us a great deal. We have sharpened my design skills while at the same time we are getting better at using the tools, specially Figma. As it is now the norm, we feel that we needed more time to finish what we had envisioned. However, we are happy with what we did in such a short amount of time. We are thankful to have worked with an outstanding group of classmates. We wish we could have iterated our prototypes more to make them better. But since this work never ends, we are happy with where they are today.
