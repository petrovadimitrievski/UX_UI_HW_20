                                    <p class="cardText "> Through user interviews, we've gained valuable insights into
                                        the challenges faced by parents and children in managing homework-related
                                        stress. Parents expressed a sincere desire to aid their school-age kids in
                                        developing effective time management skills. The struggle intensifies with
                                        mounting academic demands and the need to motivate children effectively. Our
                                        users want a solution that simplifies tasks and fosters positive work habits. By
                                        understanding these needs, we aim to create a user-centric tool that not only
                                        reduces stress for both parents and kids, but also cultivates a sense of
                                        accomplishment, contributing to a happier and more balanced family life.</p>

                                    <p class="cardText "> Through user interviews, we uncovered a recurring challenge:
                                        when faced with procrastination-related homework situations, children experience
                                        anxiety due to looming deadlines, while parents feel the added stress of
                                        juggling yet another responsibility. Parents expressed a genuine desire to
                                        support their school-age kids in developing effective time management skills and
                                        finding the right way to motivate them. To address this, we propose developing a
                                        tool that breaks down tasks into manageable daily chunks and incorporates a
                                        rewarding system to motivate task completion. This could lead to not only
                                        happier children who are self-motivated and grasp the essence of time
                                        management, but also happier parents witnessing the positive development of
                                        their children's work ethic. Striking a balance between homework and fun becomes
                                        achievable and fosters a healthier and more harmonious family dynamic.</p>

                                        procrastination. Our innovative tool breaks down tasks into manageable daily
                                        chunks and incorporates a rewarding system, transforming homework stress into
                                        success. Our approach is grounded in addressing the genuine desire expressed by
                                        parents to support their kids in developing effective time management skills.

                                        So, let’s 'Hop to Habit'—where achieving a balance between homework and fun

                                                Creating the flow helped us build a solid foundation for constructing
                                                our first prototypes. For this step, we began working individually, with
                                                each of us building low-fi prototype pages. Then, we collectively
                                                gathered them, collaborated, and decided which ones to combine for
                                                constructing our first low-fi prototype.</h3>

                                            <h3 class="pz">We were pressed for time and decided to skip the process of
                                                testing the lo-fi prototype. Instead, we opted to create the
                                                mid-fidelity prototype first and conduct testing later. Looking back, I
                                                think if we had the time, testing the lo-fi prototype would have been an
                                                important part of the process because it would have helped us discover
                                                some of our flaws. However, we did the best we could.
                                                <br>
                                                Before building the mid-fidelity prototype, we thought it was necessary
                                                to create a Moodboard and Style Tile. This step allowed us to decide, at
                                                the very least, on the basics of colors and typography. Choosing to do
                                                this was a smart step because it saved us a lot of time in the future
